===================
A front page graphic I created for a client.

Comments: Inspired by the demo on this site: [http://pepsized.com/diagonal-thumbnails-gallery](http://pepsized.com/diagonal-thumbnails-gallery/) I wanted to make the demo responsive, this is the result.  I liked the design but my client thought it was too busy, so we didn't end up using it. I thought it was cool and wanted to share it. Some breakpoints are sort of rough, I never fully refined it. But feel free to fork, improve and use it on your site.
